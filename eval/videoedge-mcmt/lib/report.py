Stage 6: terminal aggregation. Reads global_tracks.json and produces
report.json — the canonical answer to "how many unique vehicles
traversed the monitored area, and what was each one's camera path."

This is the file scripts/verify_reports.py diffs between DSF and Argo
runs to confirm both systems computed the same answer.

    Reduce global_tracks.json to a small, diffable summary.

    The output has two sections:
      counts   — unique vehicle count per class (the headline metric)
      tracks   — per-global-vehicle camera path (sorted, deterministic)

    Determinism matters for the cross-system correctness diff. Both DSF
